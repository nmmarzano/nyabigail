# Nyabigail
Make abigail say nya (Stardew Valley)

This mod is complete?? It hasn't been tested in its entirety though.
The .yaml files are the unpacked dialogue files, which can be edited and packed back into .xnb files to make further changes.

## To use this mod:
1. Make a backup copy of the files `Abigail.xnb`, `MarriageDialogue.xnb` and `MarriageDialogueAbigail.xnb` within `Stardew Valley/Content/Characters/Dialogue` so you can undo these changes eventually
2. Copy the files of the same name from `nyabigail/Packed` to `Stardew Valley/Content/Characters/Dialogue` and overwrite the original ones
3. Enjoy the nya

## To revert changes:
Just copy the backed up original three files back into the character dialogue folder
